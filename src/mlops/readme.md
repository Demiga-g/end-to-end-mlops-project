# About the Package

Here we have the functions and classes that might be used recurrently defined. In doing so, it helps prevent writing long codes by just importing the function to where needed. All you have to do is to import the function to the working space using the following command:

```bash
from mlops.<package> import <function>
from mlops.<package> import <function>
```

A logger has also been defined to aid in monitoring and easing debugging. It can be imported as follows to a workspace:

```bash
from mlops import logger
```
